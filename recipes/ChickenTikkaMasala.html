                <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
                <li>1 can (14 oz) tomato sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream or coconut milk</li>
                <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)</li>
                <li>Cooked basmati rice (for serving)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, paprika, and salt. Add the chicken pieces and coat them well with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.</li>
                <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until they are browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
                <li>In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of oil. Add the chopped onion and saut√© until it becomes soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the skillet and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the tomato sauce to the skillet and stir well. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk. Cook for another 5 minutes until the sauce is heated through.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked chicken pieces back into the skillet and stir to coat them with the sauce. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to let the flavors combine.</li>
                <li>Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro and serve hot over cooked basmati rice.</li>
            </ol>
