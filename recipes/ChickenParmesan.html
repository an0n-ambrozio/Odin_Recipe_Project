            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>Fresh basil leaves (for garnish)</li>
                <li>Olive oil (for frying)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with a mixture of breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Dredge each chicken breast in flour, shaking off any excess. Then dip it into the beaten eggs, and finally coat it with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the breaded chicken breasts and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of marinara sauce. Place the fried chicken breasts on top of the sauce. Spoon more marinara sauce over each piece of chicken.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the chicken breasts.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the chicken is cooked through.</li>
                <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.</li>
            </ol>
